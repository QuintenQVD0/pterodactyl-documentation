You will be taken to a new service option page which is where most of the configuration happens. The first thing you need to do is select your service that you created previously from the Associated Nest dropdown.  After that, enter an Option Name to describe it, in this case I am using Widget. You will also need to provide avalid docker image, as well as a start command to be assigned to servers under this service option (remember, this can be tweaked per-server if needed). Docker images must be specifically designed to work with Pterodactyl Panel. You should read more about that in our Creating a Docker Image guide. "},{"title":"Configure Process Management​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating a Custom Egg","url":"/pterodactyl-documentation/docs/community/creating_eggs/creating_a_custom_egg#configure-process-management","content":"This is perhaps the most important step in this service option configuration, as this tells the Daemon how to run everything.  The first field you'll encounter is Copy Settings From. The default selection is None. That is expected, and okay. This dropdown is discussed at the end of this article. "},{"title":"Stop Command​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating a Custom Egg","url":"/pterodactyl-documentation/docs/community/creating_eggs/creating_a_custom_egg#stop-command","content":"Next, you'll encounter Stop Command and, as the name implies, this should be the command used to safely stop the option. For some games, this is stop or end. Certain programs and games don't have a specified stop command, so you can enter ^C to have the daemon execute a SIGINT to end the process. "},{"title":"Log Storage​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating a Custom Egg","url":"/pterodactyl-documentation/docs/community/creating_eggs/creating_a_custom_egg#log-storage","content":"Logs are competely handeled by the daemon now and use the docker logs to output the complete output from the server. This can be set like below. {}  "},{"title":"Configuration Files​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating a Custom Egg","url":"/pterodactyl-documentation/docs/community/creating_eggs/creating_a_custom_egg#configuration-files","content":"The next block is one of the most complex blocks, the Configuration Files descriptor. The Daemon will process this block prior to booting the server to ensure all of the required settings are defined and set correctly. { &quot;server.properties&quot;: { &quot;parser&quot;: &quot;properties&quot;, &quot;find&quot;: { &quot;server-ip&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0&quot;, &quot;enable-query&quot;: &quot;true&quot;, &quot;server-port&quot;: &quot;{{server.build.default.port}}&quot;, &quot;query.port&quot;: &quot;{{server.build.default.port}}&quot; } } }  In this example, we are telling the Daemon to read server.properties in /home/container. Within this block, we define a parser, in this case properties but the following are valid parsers: file — This parser goes based on matching the beginning of lines, and not a specific property like the other five. Avoid using this parser if possible.yaml (supports * notation)propertiesinijson (supports * notation)xml Once you have defined a parser, we then define a find block which tells the Daemon what specific elements to find and replace. In this example, we have provided four separate items within the server.properties file that we want to find and replace to the assigned values. You can use either an exact value, or define a specific server setting from the server.json file. In this case, we're assigning the default server port to be used as the server-port andquery.port. These placeholders are case sensitive, and should have no spaces in them. You can have multiple files listed here, the Daemon will process them in parallel before starting the server. When using yaml or json you can use more advanced searching for elements. { &quot;config.yml&quot;: { &quot;parser&quot;: &quot;yaml&quot;, &quot;find&quot;: { &quot;listeners[0].query_enabled&quot;: true, &quot;listeners[0].query_port&quot;: &quot;{{server.build.default.port}}&quot;, &quot;listeners[0].host&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0:{{server.build.default.port}}&quot;, &quot;servers.*.address&quot;: { &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;: &quot;{{config.docker.interface}}&quot;, &quot;localhost&quot;: &quot;{{config.docker.interface}}&quot; } } } }  In this example, we are parsing config.yml using the yaml parser. The first three find items are simply assigning ports and IPs for the first listener block. The last one, servers.*.address uses wildcard matching to match any items within the servers block, and then finding each address block for those items. v-pre An advanced feature of this file configuration is the ability to define multiple find and replace statements for a single matching line. In this case, we are looking for either 127.0.0.1 or localhost and replacing them with the docker interface defined in the configuration file using {{config.docker.interface}}. "},{"title":"Start Configuration​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating a Custom Egg","url":"/pterodactyl-documentation/docs/community/creating_eggs/creating_a_custom_egg#start-configuration","content":"The last block to configure is the Start Configuration for servers running using this service option. { &quot;done&quot;: &quot;)! For help, type &quot; }  In the example block above, we define done as the entire line, or part of a line that indicates a server is done starting, and is ready for players to join. When the Daemon sees this output, it will mark the server as ON rather than STARTING. That concludes basic service option configuration. "},{"title":"Copy Settings From​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating a Custom Egg","url":"/pterodactyl-documentation/docs/community/creating_eggs/creating_a_custom_egg#copy-settings-from","content":"As mentioned above, there is a unique Copy Settings From dropdown when adding a new option. This gives you the ability to, as the name suggests, copy settings defined above from a different option.  In the panel, we use this to copy settings that remain the same between similar service options, such as many of the Minecraft options. For example, lets look at the Sponge (SpongeVanilla) service option. As you can see, it as been told to copy settings from Vanilla Minecraft. This means that any of the fields that are left blank will inherit from the assigned parent. We then define a specific userInteraction line that is different in Sponge compared to Vanilla, but tell it that everything else should remain the same. *Please note that Copy Settings From does not support nested copies, you can only copy from a single parent, and that parent must not be copying from another option.* "},{"title":"Egg Variables​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Creating a Custom Egg","url":"/pterodactyl-documentation/docs/community/creating_eggs/creating_a_custom_egg#egg-variables","content":"One of the great parts of the Egg Variables is the ability to define specific variables that users and/or admins can control to tweak different settings without letting users modify the startup command. To create new variables, or edit existing ones, visit the new service option you created, and click the Variables tab at the top of the page. Lets take a look at an example variable that we can create.  v-pre The name and description are rather self-explanitory, so I'll skip down to the Environment Variable box. This should be an Alpha-Numeric name with underscores, and should be uppercase. This will be the name of the environment variable which can be accessed in the startup command as {{WOOZLE_WOO}}, within file modifications as {{env.WOOZLE_WOO}}, or just ${WOOZLE_WOO} in any shell scripts (it is passed through in the environment). We also define a default value for this environment variable in this example, but it is not required to do so. The next section is Permissions, which is a dropdown with two options: Users Can View and Users Can Edit. Users Can View — allows a user to view the field on the front-end, as well as the assigned value of that variable. They will be able to see it replaced in their startup command.Users Can Edit — allows a user to edit the value of the variable, for example the name of their server.jar file if running Minecraft. You should use caution here, even if you assign neither of the permissions it does not mean that the value will be hidden. Crafty users will still be able to get the environment on their server. In most cases this is simply hiding it from the user, and then used within the Dockerfile to perform actions, thus it is not important for the user to see. Finally, you will need to define some input rules to validate the value against. In this example, we userequired|string|between:1,10, which means the field is required, must be a string, and must be between 1 and10 characters in length. You can find all of the available validation ruleson the Laravel website. You can also use ReGEX based validation by using the regex: rule flag. For example,required|regex:/^([\\w\\d._-]+)(\\.jar)$/ will require the field, and will match the regex as any letters or numbers (\\w\\d) including underscore (_), periods (.), and dashes (-) ending in .jar. They will then be visible when managing the startup for a server in both the Admin CP and on the Front-End.

These both refer to other environment variables being passed in, and they look something like the example below. SERVER_MEMORY=1024 SERVER_JARFILE=server.jar  There are a host of different environment variables, and they change depending on the specific service option configuration. However, that is not necessarily anything to worry about here. MODIFIED_STARTUP=`eval echo $(echo ${STARTUP} | sed -e 's/{{/${/g' -e 's/}}/}/g')`  v-pre The command above simply evaluates the STARTUP environment variable, and then replaces anything surrounded in curly braces {{EXAMPLE}} with a matching environment variable (such as EXAMPLE).

By collecting this data, we can hopefully have more insight to how changes like this will affect the community and make better decisions in the future. This is especially important for information like the architecture, kernel version, and operating system nodes are using. For example, we want to utilize a feature that is only present in some filesystems, but we have no idea how many people are using those filesystems, so we cannot determine if it's worth the effort to implement. Some of the data is not as useful for making decisions, but is still useful for us to know. For example, have you ever wondered how many Panel instances there are? How many servers are being ran across all of those instances? How many users are using the Panel? How many of those users are admins? How many servers are using a specific egg? How many servers are using a specific nest? All of these questions can be answered by the data we collect, and can help us and the community better understand how the software is being used. If you have any questions about the data we collect, please feel free to reach out to us on Discord.

Method 1: CertbotMethod 2: acme.sh To begin, we will install certbot, a simple script that automatically renews our certificates and allows much easier creation of them. The command below is for Ubuntu distributions, but you can always check [Certbot's official site](https://certbot.eff.org/) for installation instructions. We have also included a command below to install certbot's Nginx/Apache plugin so you won't have to stop your webserver. sudo apt update sudo apt install -y certbot # Run this if you use Nginx sudo apt install -y python3-certbot-nginx # Run this if you use Apache sudo apt install -y python3-certbot-apache Creating a Certificate​ After installing the certbot, we need to generate a certificate. There are a couple of ways to do that, but the easiest is to use the web server-specific certbot plugin you just installed. For Wings-only machines that don't need a web server, use the standalone or DNS method of the certbot as you don't need a web server for it. Then, in the command below, you should replace example.com with the domain you would like to generate a certificate for. When you have multiple domains you would like certificates for, simply add more -d anotherdomain.com flags to the command. You can also look into generating a wildcard certificate but that is not covered in this tutorial. When you are using certbot's Nginx/Apache plugin, you won't need to restart your webserver to have the certificate applied assuming that you've already configured the webservers to use SSL as instructed in the web server configuration step. HTTP challenge​ HTTP challenge requires you to expose port 80 for the challenge verification. # Nginx certbot certonly --nginx -d example.com # Apache certbot certonly --apache -d example.com # Standalone - Use this if neither works. Make sure to stop your webserver first when using this method. certbot certonly --standalone -d example.com DNS challenge​ DNS challenge requires you to create a new TXT DNS record to verify domain ownership, instead of having to expose port 80. The instructions are displayed when you run the certbot command below. certbot -d example.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly Auto Renewal​ You'll also probably want to configure the automatic renewal of certificates to prevent unexpected certificate expirations. You can open crontab with sudo crontab -e and add the line from below to the bottom of it for attempting renewal every day at 23 (11 PM). Deploy hook would restart the Nginx service to apply a new certificate when it's renewed successfully. Change nginx in the restart command to suit your own needs, such as to apache or wings. For advanced users, we suggest installing and using acme.shwhich provides more options, and is much more powerful than certbot. 0 23 * * * certbot renew --quiet --deploy-hook &quot;systemctl restart nginx&quot; Troubleshooting​ If you get an Insecure Connection or SSL/TLS related error when trying to access your panel or wings, the certificate has likely expired. This can be easily fixed by renewing the SSL certificate, although using the command certbot renew might not do the job if port 80 is in use, as it'll return errors like: Error: Attempting to renew cert (domain) from /etc/letsencrypt/renew/domain.conf produced an unexpected error. This will happen especially if you're running Nginx instead of Apache. The solution for this is to use Nginx or Apache plugins with --nginx and --apache. Alternatively, you can stop Nginx, then renew the certificate, finally restart Nginx. Replace nginx with your own web server or with wings should you be renewing the certificate for Wings. Stop Nginx: systemctl stop nginx Renew the certificate: certbot renew Once the process has complete, you can restart the Nginx service: systemctl start nginx You may also need to restart Wings as not every service is able to automatically apply an updated certificate: systemctl restart wings ","keywords":""},{"title":"Setting up MySQL","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/pterodactyl-documentation/docs/documentation/tutorials/mysql_setup","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Creating a database for Pterodactyl​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Setting up MySQL","url":"/pterodactyl-documentation/docs/documentation/tutorials/mysql_setup#creating-a-database-for-pterodactyl","content":"MySQL is a core component of Pterodactyl Panel but it can be confusing to setup and use if you've never done so before.
